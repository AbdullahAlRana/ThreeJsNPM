# ThreeJsNPM

In this repository I have tried to implement some basic functionalities of threejs on different HTML pages.

Played with different types of geometric shapes, materials etc, Orbit Controls, used npm package to make threejs run locally without any dependencies.

To run the pages you have to run it on a server (local servers like: IIS, Live server etc)
